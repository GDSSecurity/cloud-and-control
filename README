	and debugging information.

	for GNFS stuff or cracking, here it is.

	This is the config files and most importantly templates for the boinc 
	applications.

Be Intelligent
============================================================
In general, you're going to want to search for tmp_hostname and replace that 
with your temporary directory, and overall just read the stuff to see what you 
have to change.  I didn't make a note of everytime I removed my password and
put in PASSWORD for you to fill in.

No Wordlists
============================================================
I'm not including my wordlists.  Not out of secrecy, I just downloaded every 
single one I could find, stripped out the copyrights on them, and combined them.  
So I'm fairly certain doing so would be in violation of the wishes of the 
authors.  Yea, I know almost no one actually obeys that stuff, but I try to most
of the time.  You can combine your own wordlists.
 
I am however including the markov-generated wordlists.  Caveat: not actually 
very useful.

Thanks
