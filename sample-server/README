These are the files off of my BOINC server, and show my layout for the 
applications, templates, and the dashboard I added.

Make sure you read misc-notes.txt   

config.xml
config_aux.xml
	Configuration Files for the BOINC server, containing:
	 - Additional assimilator and validator daemons for all the applications
	 - Settings to ensure each client recieves only the number of workunits
	   it can run at once.  Without these, a client will reserver a number of 
	   workunits to work on 'later'.  We want to distribute all our work at 
	   once, so this reservation system messes us up.
	   config_aux does this for us.

project.xml
	The config file that defines my custom platforms, and all the applications 
	I run.
   
apps/
	releasegnfsversion.sh
	releasejohn.sh
	releasemsieveversion.sh
	
	These are simple bash scripts I wrote to copy an application to the 
	appropriate folders.
	
	cudahashcat+/
	cudahashcat+-7zwordlist/
	gnfslasieve4I11e/
	gnfslasieve4I12e/
	gnfslasieve4I13e/
	gnfslasieve4I14e/
	gnfslasieve4I15e/
	gnfslasieve4I16e/
	hashcat/
	hashcat-7zwordlist/
	john/
	msieve/
	
	These are the individual application folders.  The actual applications are 
	not present, but merely stubs so you can see the naming.
	
	The "7zwordlist" versions indicate that the wordlist is actually a 
	compressed file that must be compressed prior to running.  Some wordlists
	I used were very large.
	
	\cudahashcat+
		\cudahashcat+-wrapper_1.9_x64-xeon__cuda_fermi
	
	Here we see the application name "cudahashcat+-wrapper", the version 1.9,
	the platform x64-xeon, and the App Plan __cuda_fermi
	
			7z
			cudahashcat+-wrapper_1.9_x64-xeon__cuda_fermi
			cudahashcat=cudahashcat_0.03_x64-linux
			eula.accepted
			kernels.7z
			job.xml=job.xml-1.9-cudahashcat+

	Here are the files for this particular version.
	 - 7z is a version of 7z that will run on a x64 machine
	 - cudahashcat+-wrapper_1.9_x64-xeon__cuda_fermi is the wrapper app.
	   Not that it is the main program, and its name much match its parent 
	   folder EXACTLY.
	 - cudahashcat=cudahashcat_0.03_x64-linux has two parts: the logical name 
	   'cudahashcat' and the physical name 'cudahashcat_0.03_x64-linux"
	 - eula.accepted is a file needed by cudaHashcat
	 - kernels.7z are files used by cudaHashcat and will be unzipped before 
	   cudahashcat is run
	 - job.xml=job.xml-1.9-cudahashcat+ also has two parts: the logical name
	   job.xml (what it must be named for the wrapper app) and the physical name
	   job.xml-1.9-cudahashcat+.  
	   No two BOINC files can have the same name.  If I called it job.xml, I 
	   could never name another file job.xml, nor could I edit this one.
	   So I suggest you use this pattern for your job.xml files.
	   Inside job.xml are two tasks: one to unzip kernels.7z to the appropriate 
	   location, and the second to actually run cudahashcat+

		
		
bin/
	directory-contents.txt
	
	This file just shows how each application must have its own assimilator and
	validator, and that you can symlink them to the samples provided.
	
html/
	ops/
		index.php.patch
		status.php
		
	This is the custom dashboard I wrote to give me a refreshing, easily 
	glance-able version of all outstanding workunits.
	
templates/
	*_result.xml
	
	These are the output templates - what each application is expected to 
	produce.  The options used in various ones are:
	 - <generated_locally/> - Always present
     - <upload_when_present/> - Always present
	 - <gzip_when_done/> - gzips the file before uploading.  You will need to 
				rename the file on the server to .gz and then gunzip
	 - <open_name>output_data</open_name> - the logical name is output_data
				and there is a corresponding 
				boinc_resolve_filename("output_data") (unless copy_file is set)
	 - <optional>0</optional> - this file is NOT optional. If it is not present, 
				BOINC will treat the result as a failure.
     - <no_validate>1</no_validate> - 1 if using sample_bitwise_validator
	 - <copy_file /> - This file is written out by the application in a local 
				directory and not opened with boinc_resolve_filename.  It should be 
				copied from that directory.
				See: 'Slot Directory', 'Legacy Applications'
			
	*_wu.xml
	*_wu_wordlist.xml
	*_wu_wordlist_rules.xml
	
	These are the input templates for the applications, what each application 
	will need to run.  The options used in various ones are:
	 - <ignore_download_checks/> - This is a custom property I patched BOINC to 
				provide. If the file was modified on the server (or in transit),
				BOINC should ignore that the file's integrity is changed.
				See: TODO
	 - <sticky /> - Indicates the file should remain on the _client_ after the 
				workunit is finished.  Use if a file is used for multiple
				workunits.
	 - <no_delete/> - Indicates the file should remain on the _server_ after the 
				workunit is completed.  Use if a file is used for multiple 
				workunits.
	 - <open_name>passwordlist</open_name> - Again, the logical name.  There 
				should be a corresponding boinc_resolve_filename("passwordlist")
	 - <copy_file /> - Indicates this file should be copied INTO the local 
				directory (slot directory) used by the application
				
	
	john.conf*
	
	Pieces of the john.conf file used by my script to generate a complete 
	john.conf for distributing to clients.
