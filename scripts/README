Utility Scripts
=================================================
john-benchmarker.py
	I used this script to benchmark different versions of john patches on 
	different machines, on different hash types so I could see which was the 
	fastest.  I ultimately didn't use the results, and just settled on running
	a reasonable john version, compilation options, and patch.
	You're going to need to read this and change directory paths.
	
john-fraction-compare.py
	For a given version of john and a given 'standard' hash function
	This will tell you show much longer (or shorter) the other hash functions
	are to that standard one.  For example, MD5 is 5x faster than crypt, or
	DES is .05 times faster than crypt (meaning 20x slower)
	You're going to need to read this and change directory paths.

showmurphy.sh
	A simple one-liner that will show you the Murphy scores of the polynomials 
	found so far,
	
potupdater.sh
	This script is DESIGNED to watch as cracking results come in from clients,
	and update the john.pot and hashcat hashlist files.  This way, no extra work
	is expended cracking hashes that have already been cracked.  Not important
	for hashes like MD5 or NTLM, but potentially valuable for Unix MD5 or 
	Blowfish.
	
	This script requires files be named very specifically (corresponding to 
	genjohnwu.php), and that BOINC server and client be patched to add the 
	ignore_download_checks option to input templates.  The file's hash will 
	change when it's rewritten, so without that patch, the workunit will error.
	
	The script has a bug in it.  I'm not quite sure where though.  It causes the 
	resulting .pot and hashcat files to be screwy though.  If you actually want 
	to try it, I suggest you set up a large NTLM set of hashes and run them.
	
gunzipresults.sh
	Your results may be uploaded gzipped if you specified gzip_when_done in your
	output template.  However, the files don't have the .gz suffix.  This script
	will run through sample_results, find the gzipped ones, and gunzip them.
	
shutdownBoincSlave.sh
	I used this delayed startup script to know whether or not to shut down my 
	instances.  I can control them all at once by changing the text file on my
	webserver.
	
	
=================================================
Factoring Scripts (in logical order)
=================================================
Makefile
mkpolysearchrange.cpp
	Takes a file containing only the semiprime to be factored, and produces
	workunits for running in msieve.
	
	You will need to edit it to write to the appropriate temp file directory.
	(Search for tmp_hostname)
	

gengnfsjob.php
	Takes a chosen polynomial and creates a job template for use with 
	gengnfswu.php.  
	This script contains logic taken from GGNFS, factLat.pl[1], and 
	factmsieve.py[2].  A lot of this logic is old knowledge passed down
	in the form of text files like def-par.txt that give default values
	and are full of magic constants.
	
	When I wrote this, I wanted to make sure it produced the same output as
	factmsieve.py, so I wrote the comparison script in genjob-testharness/
	
gengnfswu.php
	Generates work units for GGNFS.  Relatively straightforward script.

	
	
[1] factLat.pl is the original fire-and-forget factoring script that runs 
    multiple programs through the semiprime factoring process. 
	http://gilchrist.ca/jeff/factoring/nfs_beginners_guide_perl.html
[2] factmsieve.py is an update to factLat.pl by Brian Gladman take scripts the 
    entire factoring process for a fire-and-forget manner.  Of course it doesn't
	work well when that's a 3 month process for a 512 bit semiprime. ;)

Cracking Scripts
=================================================
genjohnwu.php
genjohnwu-tools.php
	I am not pround of this script.  But, it works (at least for me).
	It started simply enough, similar to gengnfswu.php - so I never bothered 
	refactoring it or writing it in another language.  Instead I just kept
	hacking it, and it grew and grew into the pile of shit it is now. Sorry.
	Fair warning - it uses a lot of global variables to keep state.  I know.
	
	This script produces workunits for cracking.
	It requires:
		-b the base name for the workunits
		-c a john.pot file that should contain a few cracked passwords already
		   this is assumed to exist, cause you run john --single mode w/o boinc
		-f the format of the hash type you are operating on. Run without options
		   to get a list
		-a the application name you want to run.  
		--hashcat-hashes the list of hashes you want to crack, in the format 
		                 acceptable to hashcat
						 If you are not running hashcat, you can give /dev/null
		--john-hashes	 this list of hashes you want to crack, in the format
						 acceptable to john
						 Always required, because it is used for salt counts
		-p the 'phase' of cracking you want to run
		
	Running this script with a POSITIVE integer phase, will tell you the 
	subphases.  Example:
	
	$ ./genjohnwu.php -a john -c /SCRATCH/korelogictrialrun/phase1/NT.txt/john.pot -b newjohn -f nt --john-hashes=/SCRATCH/korelogictrialrun/hashes/john/NT.txt --hashcat-hashes=/dev/null -p 2
	generating work for newjohn...
	Working on Phase 2
	Run Phases 2.1 (wordlists) and 2.2 (incremental)

	Run it again with the subphase to actually create the work script.  
	
	$ ./genjohnwu.php -a john -c /SCRATCH/korelogictrialrun/phase1/NT.txt/john.pot -b newjohn -f nt --john-hashes=/SCRATCH/korelogictrialrun/hashes/john/NT.txt --hashcat-hashes=/dev/null -p 2.1
	generating work for newjohn...
	Working on Phase 2.1
	.........10
	..........20
	..........30
	..........40
	...
	done, created 42 jobs
	
	./genjohnwu.php -a hashcat -c /SCRATCH/korelogictrialrun/phase1/NT.txt/john.pot -b hashcattest -f nt --john-hashes=/SCRATCH/korelogictrialrun/hashes/john/NT.txt --hashcat-hashes=/SCRATCH/korelogictrialrun/hashes/hashcat/mode-1000 -p 3.1
	generating work for hashcattest...
	Working on Phase 3.1
	.........10
	..........20
	..........30
	.........
	done, created 38 jobs


	Running it with negative integers are various specific testing phases. For 
	example, -1 - merely prints the wordlist names it will generate jobs for.
	
	It does a lot of weird shit, one of which is in some cases it will actually 
	invoke john the ripper if necessary to determine the salt count.  This is
	in getSaltCount() - and you will need to edit it with your paths to make 
	sure it works.
